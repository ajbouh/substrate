A full example on how to run a rwkv model is in the [examples](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI/tree/master/examples/rwkv).

Note: rwkv models needs to specify the backend `rwkv` in the YAML config files and have an associated tokenizer along that needs to be provided with it:

```
36464540 -rw-r--r--  1 mudler mudler 1.2G May  3 10:51 rwkv_small
36464543 -rw-r--r--  1 mudler mudler 2.4M May  3 10:51 rwkv_small.tokenizer.json
```
