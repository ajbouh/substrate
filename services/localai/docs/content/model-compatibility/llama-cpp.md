[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is a popular port of Facebook's LLaMA model in C/C++.

{{% notice note %}}

The `ggml` file format has been deprecated. If you are using `ggml` models and you are configuring your model with a YAML file, specify, use the `llama-ggml` backend instead. If you are relying in automatic detection of the model, you should be fine. For `gguf` models, use the `llama` backend. The go backend is deprecated as well but still available as `go-llama`. The go backend supports still features not available in the mainline: speculative sampling and embeddings.

## Features

The `llama.cpp` model supports the following features:
- [üìñ Text generation (GPT)]({{%relref "features/text-generation" %}})
- [üß† Embeddings]({{%relref "features/embeddings" %}})
- [üî• OpenAI functions]({{%relref "features/openai-functions" %}})
- [‚úçÔ∏è Constrained grammars]({{%relref "features/constrained_grammars" %}})

## Setup

LocalAI supports `llama.cpp` models out of the box. You can use the `llama.cpp` model in the same way as any other model. 

### Manual setup

It is sufficient to copy the `ggml` or `guf` model files in the `models` folder. You can refer to the model in the `model` parameter in the API calls.

[You can optionally create an associated YAML]({{%relref "advanced" %}}) model config file to tune the model's parameters or apply a template to the prompt.

Prompt templates are useful for models that are fine-tuned towards a specific prompt. 

### Automatic setup

LocalAI supports model galleries which are indexes of models. For instance, the huggingface gallery contains a large curated index of models from the huggingface model hub for `ggml` or `gguf` models.

For instance, if you have the galleries enabled, you can just start chatting with models in huggingface by running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
     "model": "TheBloke/WizardLM-13B-V1.2-GGML/wizardlm-13b-v1.2.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
     "temperature": 0.1
   }'
```

LocalAI will automatically download and configure the model in the `model` directory.

Models can be also preloaded or downloaded on demand. To learn about model galleries, check out the [model gallery documentation]({{%relref "models" %}}).

### YAML configuration

To use the `llama.cpp` backend, specify `llama` as the backend in the YAML file:

```yaml
name: llama
backend: llama
parameters:
  # Relative to the models path
  model: file.gguf.bin
```

In the example above we specify `llama` as the backend to restrict loading `gguf` models only. 

For instance, to use the `llama-ggml` backend for `ggml` models:

```yaml
name: llama
backend: llama-ggml
parameters:
  # Relative to the models path
  model: file.ggml.bin
```
