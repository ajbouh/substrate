## What can you build with LLMStack?

Using LLMStack you can build a variety of generative AI applications, chatbots and agents. Here are some examples:

**üìù Text generation**: You can build apps that generate product descriptions, blog posts, news articles, tweets, emails, chat messages, etc., by using text generation models and optionally connecting your data. Check out this [marketing content generator](https://trypromptly.com/app/50ee8bae-712e-4b95-9254-74d7bcf3f0cb) for example

**ü§ñ Chatbots**: You can build chatbots trained on your data powered by ChatGPT like [Promptly Help](https://trypromptly.com/app/f4d7cb50-1805-4add-80c5-e30334bce53c) that is embedded on Promptly website

**üé® Multimedia generation**: Build complex applications that can generate text, images, videos, audio, etc. from a prompt. This [story generator](https://trypromptly.com/app/9d6da897-67cf-4887-94ec-afd4b9362655) is an example

**üó£Ô∏è Conversational AI**: Build conversational AI systems that can have a conversation with a user. Check out this [Harry Potter character chatbot](https://trypromptly.com/app/bdeb9850-b32e-44cf-b2a8-e5d54dc5fba4)

**üîç Search augmentation**: Build search augmentation systems that can augment search results with additional information using APIs. Sharebird uses LLMStack to augment search results with AI generated answer from their content similar to Bing's chatbot

**üí¨ Discord and Slack bots**: Apps built on LLMStack can be triggered from Slack or Discord. You can easily connect your AI chains to Slack or Discord from LLMStack's no-code app editor. Check out our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3JsEzSXspJ) to interact with one such bot.
