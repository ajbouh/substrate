## Install

### Local via docker

Running via docker and integrating with your LocalAI instance is a breeze.

First, pull in the latest AnythingLLM Docker image
`docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm:master`

Next, run the image on a container exposing port `3001`.
`docker run -d -p 3001:3001 mintplexlabs/anythingllm:master`

Now open `http://localhost:3001` and you will start on-boarding for setting up your AnythingLLM instance to your comfort level


## Integration with your LocalAI instance.

There are two areas where you can leverage your models loaded into LocalAI - LLM and Embedding. Any LLM models should be ready to run a chat completion.

### LLM model selection

During onboarding and from the sidebar setting you can select `LocalAI` as your LLM. Here you can set both the model and token limit of the specific model. The dropdown will automatically populate once your url is set.

The URL should look like `http://localhost:8000/v1` or wherever your LocalAI instance is being served from. Non-localhost URLs are permitted if hosting LocalAI on cloud services.

### LLM embedding model selection

During onboarding and from the sidebar setting you can select `LocalAI` as your preferred embedding engine. This model will be the model used when you upload any kind of document via AnythingLLM. Here you can set the model from available models via the LocalAI API. The dropdown will automatically populate once your url is set.

The URL should look like `http://localhost:8000/v1` or wherever your LocalAI instance is being served from. Non-localhost URLs are permitted if hosting LocalAI on cloud services.
