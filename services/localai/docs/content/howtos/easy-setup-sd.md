To set up a Stable Diffusion model is super easy.
In your ``models`` folder make a file called ``stablediffusion.yaml``, then edit that file with the following. (You can change ``Linaqruf/animagine-xl`` with what ever ``sd-lx`` model you would like.
```yaml
name: animagine-xl
parameters:
  model: Linaqruf/animagine-xl
backend: diffusers

# Force CPU usage - set to true for GPU
f16: false
diffusers:
  cuda: false # Enable for GPU usage (CUDA)
  scheduler_type: dpm_2_a
```

If you are using docker, you will need to run in the localai folder with the ``docker-compose.yaml`` file in it
```bash
docker compose down
```

Then in your ``.env`` file uncomment this line.
```yaml
COMPEL=0
```

After that we can reinstall the LocalAI docker VM by running in the localai folder with the ``docker-compose.yaml`` file in it
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then to download and setup the model, Just send in a normal ``OpenAI`` request! LocalAI will do the rest!
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/images/generations -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "prompt": "Two Boxes, 1blue, 1red",
  "size": "1024x1024"
}'
```
