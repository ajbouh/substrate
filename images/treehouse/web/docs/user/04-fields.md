## Fields

A **field** is a node that can store structured information. Fields provide your data with structure, and allow for special search syntax (see [Smart Nodes](#smart-nodes)).

### Create a field

To add a field to a node:
1. Indent underneath the node you want to contain the field, and type the field name
2. Use Command/Control + K to open the command palette, and choose "Create field"
3. Add your field value in the value section
