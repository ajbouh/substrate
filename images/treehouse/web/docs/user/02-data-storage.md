## Data Storage

### Localstorage

By default, data is stored in your browser’s local storage. That means that the data is linked to your specific browser and device. If you clear your browser cache, the data will be wiped.

### GitHub

If you choose to log in with GitHub, we’ll create a repository and store your data there.

To store your workspace, we will create a public repository called <username>.treehouse.sh if it doesn’t already exist. If you want to make the repository private, you can do so in GitHub.

To switch back to the local storage backend, log out from the Options menu.

#### Multiple sessions

If you log in to Treehouse from multiple devices, the most recent device will have edit and save access. Other sessions will be prompted to refresh the page; if/when you do so, that session becomes the new active session.
