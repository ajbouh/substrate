## It begins...

This first [development release](https://github.com/treehousedev/treehouse/releases/tag/0.1.0) captures core functionality of the frontend to the point of being internally usable in the demo deployment. For developers, the project source layout, architecture, and backend API is defined in broad strokes in the right direction but is by no means stable.
