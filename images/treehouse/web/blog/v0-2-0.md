## New design system, GitHub session locking, and documentation

[This release](https://github.com/treehousedev/treehouse/releases/tag/0.2.0) is a refinement of our initial release, fixing a number of bugs and adding interaction improvements. The look and feel of the UI was also updated with the start of a new CSS design system based on custom properties. Session locking was added for the live demo and GitHub backend so multiple devices/browsers/tabs don't clobber changes of each other. Documentation also got an upgrade with the start of a [full guide](https://treehouse.sh/docs/quickstart/) on the website.
