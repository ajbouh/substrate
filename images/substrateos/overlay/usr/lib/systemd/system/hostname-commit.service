# All services which use ConditionFirstBoot=yes should use
# Before=first-boot-complete.target, which is a target that
# was introduced in https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4511
# and hasn't propagated everywhere yet. Once the target propagates
# everywhere, we can drop the systemd-machine-id-commit.service
# from the Before= line.
