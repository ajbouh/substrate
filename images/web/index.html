            <h3>About us</h3>
            <p>
                We're building an open, extensible hardware and software platform for running AI at home and at work.
            </p>

            <p>
                We're exploring UIs that can support systems that are 1000x more intelligent than we have today.
            </p>

            <p>
                Systems that can collaborate with a person on all levels of their life and work.
                Systems that anyone in the world can understand, extend, and improve.
            </p>

            <h3>Our approach</h3>
            <p>
                We believe AI is the future of both computing and the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                We focus on technologies that operate on the individual and community-scale, and counterbalance today's global centralization and winner-take-all dynamics
            </p>

            <p>
                We have a long term, positive-sum approach to building and investing in new technologies:

                <ol>
                    <li>Fund nimble teams of ambitious people for extended periods.</li>

                    <li>Encourage those teams to invent new technologies that enable ambitious, ecosystem-scale goals.</li>

                    <li>Set those technologies free. Open sourcing those technologies, and teach others how to use them.</li>

                    <li>Actively inspire others to innovate and productize those technologies.</li>
            
                    <li>Buy equity in promising commercial ventures deploying those technologies. Inviting others to do their own product development and market validation means a larger pie and greater leverage.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
                <h4>Why run locally?</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Lots of local devices and sensors â†’ HCI possibilities are awesome</li>
                <li>It's cheaper, more fun, and is better aligned with end users</li>
                <li>When users pay for their own equipment and electricity, there is no need to "monetize" them</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Why a AI-specific computer?</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>AI has extreme memory, compute, bandwidth requirements. The needs for space, bandwidth, cooling, and power are beyond that of phones, tablets, laptops and desktops.</li>
                <li>Enterprise-grade hardware can work, but it's expensive, loud, difficult to use, and hard to buy</li>
                <li>For things to keep moving, we need a common dev target for the entire ecosystem</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Why open and extensible?</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Invites creativity and experimentation from others *and* our future selves</li>
                <li>Allows value accrue to the end users</li>
                <li>Ensures that such a powerful technology can't be captured by any single entity</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Why an OS?</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Sub-second model loading requires tuning hardware, drivers, filesystems</li>
                <li>Easier to do whole-system optimizations (for example, per $ and per watt)</li>
                <li>Initial experience, upgrades, debugging are all easier (a smaller support matrix means higher quality)</li>
                </ul>
