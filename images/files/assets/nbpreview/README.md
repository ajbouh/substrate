# nbpreview

`nbpreview` is a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)/[IPython](http://ipython.org/) notebook previewer. It does not require an internet connection, or even having Jupyter/IPython installed.

You can use [__this hosted version__](https://jsvine.github.io/nbpreview/) or `git clone` your own. Just drag-and-drop your `.ipynb` file onto the filepicker, and *voil√†!*

## Local / Offline Usage

To run `nbpreview` on your own computer, clone or [download](archive/master.zip) this repository, and then open `index.html`.

Alternatively, you can run a local server by executing `python3 -m http.server 8000` in the `nbpreview` directory, after which you can visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
