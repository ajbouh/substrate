* Enables AI exploration with full data control in a multi-user pilot.
* Supports broad ecosystem of AI models from OpenAI and Microsoft to open source LLMs from Hugging Face.
* Speeds development of custom security, compliance and data custody policy from early evaluation to future scale.

Unliked closed source, vendor-controlled environments where data controls cannot be audited, OpenOps provides a transparent, open source, customer-controlled platform for developing, securing and auditing AI-accelerated workflows. 

### Why Open Ops?

Everyone is in a race to deploy generative AI solutions, but need to do so in a responsible and safe way. OpenOps lets you run powerful models in a safe sandbox to establish the right safety protocols before rolling out to users. Here's an example of an evaluation, implementation, and iterative rollout process: 

- **Phase 1:** Set up the OpenOps collaboration sandbox, a self-hosted service providing multi-user chat and integration with GenAI. *(this repository)*

- **Phase 2:** Evaluate different GenAI providers, whether from public SaaS services like OpenAI or local open source models, based on your security and privacy requirements.

- **Phase 3:** Invite select early adopters (especially colleagues focusing on trust and safety) to explore and evaluate the GenAI based on their workflows. Observe behavior, and record user feedback, and identify issues. Iterate on workflows and usage policies together in the sandbox. Consider issues such as data leakage, legal/copyright, privacy, response correctness and appropriateness as you apply AI at scale.

- **Phase 4:** Set and implement policies as availability is incrementally rolled out to your wider organization.

### What does OpenOps include?

Deploying the OpenOps sandbox includes the following components: 
- üè∞ **Mattermost Server** - Open source, self-hosted alternative to Discord and Slack for strict security environments with playbooks/workflow automation, tools integration, real time 1-1 and group messaging, audio calling and screenshare.  
- üìô **PostgreSQL** - Database for storing private data from multi-user, chat collaboration discussions and audit history.    
- ü§ñ [**Mattermost AI plugin**](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-ai) - Extension of Mattermost platform for AI bot and generative AI integration. 
- ü¶ô **Open Source, Self-Hosted LLM models** - Models for evaluation and use case development from Hugging Face and other sources, including GPT4All (runs on a laptop in 4.2 GB) and Falcon LLM (example of leading scaled self-hosted models). Uses [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI).
- üîåüß†  ***(Configurable)* Closed Source, Vendor-Hosted AI models** - SaaS-based GenAI models from Azure AI, OpenAI, & Anthropic.  
- üîåüì± ***(Configurable)* Mattermost Mobile and Desktop Apps** - End-user apps for future production deployment.
