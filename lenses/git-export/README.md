Need to add ability to edit config files using:
- https://github.com/sorenisanerd/gotty
- https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd
- (runner up: https://github.com/coder/wsep)
- (ttyd and gotty based on https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js)

And a text editor:
- nano
- emacs
- vim
- or https://micro-editor.github.io/
