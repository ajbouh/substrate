## Overview
Substrate is a new kind of computer console specialized for running AI at home and work

The console is paired with an open source operating system and suite of applications. Our goal is to make both hardware and software radically accessible —  to teach the world not just how to use the AI and appliance, but how they can make (and re-make!) it themselves.

Our first iteration of the console will be a kit that people can build in their own home or office.

Today, upgrading a computer usually means replacing components — but our unique approach is to design modular systems users can upgrade through expansion. 

In practice this means a single initial machine with cables that can be plugged into one or more "expansion boxes". People can invest in expanding these systems over many years. With each expansion, the system can assist in more activities and bring more smarts to each of them.

We have plans for single-, double-, and quad-accelerator expansion boxes that can be plugged into a variety of machines. The plans will be available in early 2024. The double reuses all the parts of the single, and the quad reuses all the parts of the single and double.
Who It's For
Initially, this project will serve hackers who want to build and collaborate with one another on local and intelligent systems. 

### What It Is

#### What you get in the mail:
- Substrate System 0 is an easy-to-assemble kit AI console for home and work.

#### Once built, it runs:
- SubstrateOS, an operating system that boots from a USB drive and schedules AI models on internal and external consumer GPUs.

#### Once booted, it can:
- M0.1. Join in on real-world conversations with your other devices.

- M0.2. Take meeting and lecture notes so you can pay full attention to the speakers. [Liv]

- M0.3. Identify and link to more info on people, events, and cited documents. [Liv]

- M0.4. Keep an at-hand, ever-present record of conversation, tasks, and specific contributions. This captures good ideas as they happen, foster new connections between them, and helps maintain understanding between collaborators. [Matt] [Liv]

- M0.5. Eliminate language barriers by translating between any number of supported languages in real-time, across speech and text.

- M0.6. Respond only when actively addressed directly or indirectly, so using its name in a sentence does not result in false positives, but people also don't need to keep using its name explicitly to continue a conversation

- M0.7. Self-assess its reasoning capabilities so it knows what it can do and how well it performs relative to expectations.

- M0.8. Cast wirelessly to nearby displays. [?Jeff]

- M0.9. Help draft comparative analyses of ideas shared in both documents and live interactions.

- M0.10. Allow you to build and contribute new functionality others can immediately adopt. [?Jeff]

- M0.11. Provide alternative heuristics for approaching a problem (but not the answer). For example: "have you considered breaking the problem down into smaller chunks"; "have you a different representation for the problem?" (the agent tries to make the person think.) [Yoshiki]

- M0.12. Track, integrate and synthesize a set of ongoing concerns or questions with media collected, notes, links saved [Matt]

#### Collaborators can go beyond this and
Build their own services and add them to the system
