## Smart Nodes

Smart Nodes allow you to create an auto-updating search of all the nodes in your workspace. Simply type your search term, or use the format "fieldname:valuename" to filter specifically by field values. The Smart Node will update automatically as your node content changes. This is a simple but super powerful way to view your data in new configurations.

To create a Smart Node:
1. Create a new node where you want your Smart Node, and type your search value
2. Use Command/Control + K to open the command palette, and choose "Create Smart Node"

### Tips for using Smart Nodes
* You can filter on multiple fieldname values (using AND, not OR) like so: "fieldname:valuename fieldname:valuename" etc.
* If your fieldname has spaces, put quotes around it (fieldname:"Value name")
* Search terms are case-insensitive
