## Views

You can view your data in many different ways using commands in the Command Palette.

### Document
Converting your node(s) to document view centers them in the panel, styles the nodes like paragraphs, and supports basic Markdown formatting.

*Note: document view is a one-way conversion. Document nodes can't be converted back to List (outline) view.*

#### Create a Document
With your cursor on the parent node of the node(s) you want to convert to a document, open the Command Palette and select **Make Document**.

#### Markdown formatting

##### Text styles
```html
*italic* or _italic_
**bold**
~~strikethrough~~
```
##### Lists
```html
- unordered lists
* with any of
+ these characters

1. ordered
2. lists
```

### Table
Useful for a set of nodes with common fields. Node fields will become columns.

#### Use Table View
With your cursor on the parent node of the nodes you want to convert to a document, open the Command Palette and select **View As Table**.

To revert back to List (outline) view, select the parent node and choose "View as List" from the Command Palette.

### Tabs
The tab view tidies up a common group of nodes, allowing you to view one tab at a time.

#### Use Tabs View
With your cursor on the parent node of the nodes you want to convert to a document, open the Command Palette and select **View As Tabs**.
