## Tags

Tags are versatile metadata. Here are some of the ways you can use them:

* Conduct a keyword search in the searchbar
* Use in Smart Nodes to create custom views
* Use to add a template to a node

### Create a tag
On any node, with your cursor at the end of the text, type "#" then the tag name to create a tag. Any tags you have already created will show up in an autocomplete list when you type "#".

### Delete a tag
Click on the tag and press Backspace on your keyboard to delete it.
