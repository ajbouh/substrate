## Customizing the Frontend

The easiest aspect to customize is the look and feel, which you can do with custom CSS. Our CSS design system is built with
custom properties, so you can include your own CSS and just override them with basic CSS.

Further customization might require you to fork and change the source. The source code is very straight forward, but learn
more in the Developer Guide.

Lastly, of course, you can implement a custom backend adapter. Although there are just a few things to change this way,
more extension points will be exposed in the future so you won't have to change source. Let us know in the forum what kind
of extension points you'd like!
